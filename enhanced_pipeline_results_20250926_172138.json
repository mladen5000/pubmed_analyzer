      "title": "Benefit-Risk Reporting for FDA-Cleared Artificial Intelligence-Enabled Medical Devices.",
      "journal": "JAMA health forum",
      "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: Devices enabled by artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are increasingly used in clinical settings, but there are concerns regarding benefit-risk assessment and surveillance by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). OBJECTIVE: To characterize pre- and postmarket efficacy, safety, and risk assessment reporting for FDA-cleared AI/ML devices. DESIGN AND SETTING: This was a cross-sectional study using linked data from FDA decision summaries and approvals databases, the FDA Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience Database, and the FDA Medical Device Recalls Database for all AI/ML devices cleared by the FDA from September 1995 to July 2023. Data were analyzed from October to November 2024. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: AI/ML reporting of study design, data availability, efficacy, safety, bias assessments, adverse events, device recalls, and risk classification. RESULTS: The analysis included data for all 691 AI/ML devices that received FDA clearance through 2023, with 254 (36.8%) cleared in or after 2021. Device summaries often failed to report study designs (323 [46.7%]), training sample size (368 [53.3%]), and/or demographic information (660 [95.5%]). Only 6 devices (1.6%) reported data from randomized clinical trials and 53 (7.7%) from prospective studies. Few premarket summaries contained data published in peer-reviewed journals (272 [39.4%]) or provided statistical or clinical performance, including sensitivity (166 [24.0%]), specificity (152 [22.0%]), and/or patient outcomes (3 [<1%]). Some devices reported safety assessments (195 [28.2%]), adherence to international safety standards (344 [49.8%]), and/or risks to health (42 [6.1%]). In all, 489 adverse events were reported involving 36 (5.2%) devices, including 458 malfunctions, 30 injuries, and 1 death. A total of 40 devices (5.8%) were recalled 113 times, primarily due to software issues. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This cross-sectional study suggests that despite increasing clearance of AI/ML devices, standardized efficacy, safety, and risk assessment by the FDA are lacking. Dedicated regulatory pathways and postmarket surveillance of AI/ML safety events may address these challenges.",

      "title": "TCM-navigator, a deep learning-based workflow for generation and evaluation of traditional Chinese medicine-like compounds for drug development.",
      "journal": "Briefings in bioinformatics",
      "abstract": "Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) has long been regarded as a valuable resource for modern drug discovery. However, the limited availability of recorded entities and information, the complexity and sparsity of the herb-ingredient-target-disease network, and inconsistencies in data representation hinder the effectiveness of high-throughput screening approaches. While some therapeutically valuable compounds from TCM have been discovered through manual experimental screening, such methods are time-consuming and require substantial human resources. To address these challenges, we developed a data-driven and deep learning-based workflow, TCM-navigator, which enables the in-silico generation, quality control, and physics-based evaluation of TCM-like molecules. The generation is done by TCM-Generator, a transfer learning- and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)-based chemical language model that generates standardized, hierarchically structured, and high-throughput-friendly datasets of TCM-like molecules. In this study, we generated a target-nonspecific dataset comprising 3.7 million TCM-like molecules, expanding the number of entities in existing TCM datasets by more than 100-fold. The workflow also enables flexible, goal-driven molecule generation customized for specific targets, yielding three target-specific datasets and multiple high-potential target-ligand pairs. The quality control is done by TCM-Identifier, the first quantitative model specifically designed to capture unique characteristics of TCM, using an AttentiveFP framework with message passing neural networks. TCM-Identifier is expected to serve as an essential evaluation and guidance tool for TCM-related drug development. Our workflow bridges cutting-edge data science-including deep learning-with biomedical research to tackle longstanding challenges in target identification and molecular design. Its adaptable framework is also transferable to interdisciplinary innovation beyond drug development.",

      "journal": "mAbs",
      "abstract": "Experimental screening for biopharmaceutical developability properties typically relies on resource-intensive, and time-consuming assays such as size exclusion chromatography (SEC). This study highlights the potential of in silico models to accelerate the screening process by exploring sequence and structure-based machine learning techniques. Specifically, we compared surrogate models based on pre-computed features extracted from sequence and predicted structure with sequence-based approaches using protein language models (PLMs) like ESM-2. In addition to different end-to-end fine-tuning strategies for PLM, we have also investigated the integration of the structural information of the antibodies into the prediction pipeline through graph neural networks (GNN). We applied these different methods for predicting protein aggregation propensity using a dataset of approximately 1200 Immunoglobulin G (IgG1) molecules. Through this empirical evaluation, our study identifies the most effective in silico approach for predicting developability properties for SEC assays, thereby adding insights to existing screening efforts for accelerating the antibody development process.",

      "journal": "Sub-cellular biochemistry",
      "abstract": "Molecular crowding plays a crucial role in biological and medicinal systems, impacting the structure, behavior, and function of biomolecules within the densely packed environments of cells. This chapter provides an overview of the implications of molecular crowding, exploring how the high concentration of macromolecules such as proteins, nucleic acids, and other biological entities impacts biochemical reactions and cellular processes. The discussion highlights the challenges associated with experimental studies of molecular crowding, including challenges in creating accurate in vitro models, controlling concentrations, and isolating crowding effects from other interactions. To address these challenges, the chapter emphasizes the importance of computational techniques. Various computational approaches, including molecular dynamics simulations, Monte Carlo simulations, Brownian dynamics, lattice-models, finite element analysis, coarse-grained modeling, quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics simulations, and multi-scale modeling, are discussed in detail. Each of these techniques contributes unique insights into the molecular-level impacts of crowding, enhancing our understanding of biophysical processes critical for therapeutic development and biological function.

      "title": "FairDITA: Disentangled Image-Text Alignment for Fair Skin Cancer Diagnosis.",
      "journal": "Journal of imaging informatics in medicine",
      "abstract": "Recent advances in deep learning have significantly improved skin cancer classification, yet concerns regarding algorithmic fairness persist because of performance disparities across skin tone groups. Existing methods often attempt to mitigate bias by suppressing sensitive attributes within images. However, they are fundamentally limited by the entanglement of lesion characteristics and skin tone in visual inputs. To address this challenge, we propose a novel contrastive learning framework that leverages explicitly constructed image-text pairs to disentangle lesion condition features from skin tone attributes. Our architecture consists of a shared text encoder and two specialized image encoders that independently align image features with the corresponding textual descriptions of lesion characteristics and skin tone. Furthermore, we measure the semantic distance between lesion conditions and skin color embeddings in both image- and text-embedding spaces and perform optimal representation alignment by matching the distances in the image space to those in the text space. We validated our method using two benchmark datasets, PAD-UFES-20 and Fitzpatrick17k, which span a wide range of skin tones. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach consistently improves both classification accuracy and fairness across multiple evaluation metrics.",

      "title": "Harnessing Geospatial Artificial Intelligence (GeoAI) for Environmental Epidemiology: A Narrative Review.",
      "journal": "Current environmental health reports",
      "abstract": "PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Geospatial analysis is an essential tool for research on the role of environmental exposures and health, and critical for understanding impacts of environmental risk factors on diseases with long latency (e.g. cardiovascular disease, dementia, cancers) as well as upstream behaviors including sleep, physical activity, and cognition. There is emerging interest in leveraging machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) for environmental epidemiology research. In this review, we provide an accessible overview of recent advances. RECENT FINDINGS: There have been two major recent shifts in geospatial data types and analytic methods. First, novel methods for statistical prediction, combining geospatial analysis with machine learning and artificial intelligence (GeoAI), allow for scalable geospatial exposure assessment within large population health databases (e.g. cohorts, administrative claims). Second, the widespread adoption of smartphones and wearables with global positioning systems and other sensors has allowed for passive data collection from people, and when combined with geographic information systems, enables exposure assessment at finer spatial scales and temporal resolution than ever before. Illustrative examples include refining models for predicting outdoor air pollution exposure, characterizing populations susceptible to water pollution, and use of deep learning to classify Street View image-derived measures of greenspace. While these tools and approaches may facilitate more rapid, higher quality objective exposure measures, they pose challenges with respect to participant privacy, representativeness of collected data, and curation of high quality validation sets for training of GeoAI algorithms. GeoAI approaches are beginning to be used for environmental exposure assessment and behavioral outcome ascertainment with higher spatial and temporal precision than before. Epidemiologists should continue to apply critical assessment of measurement accuracy and design validity when incorporating these new tools into their work.",

      "title": "Computational prediction of diagnostic biomarker candidates and prognostic gene signature from DNA replication-related genes in breast cancer.",
      "journal": "Discover oncology",
      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Given the role of DNA replication in tumorigenesis, identifying diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers of this process using machine learning approaches may reveal new therapeutic targets and improve prognostic assessment in breast cancer. METHODS: Differentially expressed DNA replication genes in breast cancer were identified from two independent datasets. SVM-RFE was applied to distinguish the most informative diagnostic genes in breast cancer. The prognostic gene signature was constructed with LASSO Cox regression. ROC and KM analyses were performed to assess the gene signature. Independence of the gene signature was evaluated by univariate and multivariate Cox regression. The prognostic value of the gene signature was assessed in clinical subgroups. WGCNA was conducted to identify the genes co-expressed with the signature genes, followed by GO BP and KEGG enrichment analysis. RESULTS: The AUCs showed the strong performance of the SVM-RFE in training and external validation sets. The genes with highest SVM-RFE importance score have potential as diagnostic biomarker candidates. Prognostic DNA replication-related gene signature consisted of four genes and patients in high-risk group showed poor overall survival. The gene signature showed moderate discrimination based on AUC values and was found to be an independent prognostic factor. Co-expressed genes identified by WGCNA were enriched for cell cycle, chromosome segregation, and DNA replication and repair terms. CONCLUSION: SVM-RFE proved to be a valuable machine-learning method to detect diagnostic genes and a novel prognostic DNA replication-related gene signature was proposed to predict overall survival in breast cancer.",

      "title": "Integrated multi-omics analysis reveals PTM networks as key regulators of colorectal cancer progression and immune evasion.",
      "journal": "Discover oncology",
      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a leading cause of cancer mortality, with treatment resistance often driven by molecular heterogeneity and an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). Post-translational modifications (PTMs) regulate key oncogenic processes, but their comprehensive role in CRC progression and immune evasion remains unexplored. METHODS: We integrated multi-omics data from bulk RNA-seq (GEO/TCGA, n = 1,783), single-cell transcriptomics (41,143 cells), and Mendelian randomization. Differential expression, GSVA, and machine learning (LASSO/SVM/Random Forest) were used to identify PTM-associated signatures. Functional validation included spatial transcriptomics, and immune profiling. RESULTS: Multi-omics analysis identified dysregulation in 80% of PTM pathways in CRC, with ubiquitination sustaining Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling and GALNT6-mediated glycosylation driving immune evasion through PD-L1 stabilization and CD8 + T cell exclusion. Single-cell analysis revealed GALNT6-specific enrichment in immune-excluded goblet cells (p < 0.05). Machine learning derived a 5-gene PTM Activity Signature (CCNB1IP1, GALNT6, NEDD4L, PSMD14, UBE2C) that distinguish between patients with diseases and those without (AUC = 1.00). GALNT6 was validated as a causal risk factor (OR = 1.10, 95%CI:1.01-1.18), with its inhibition synergizing with anti-PD-1 to enhance CD8 + T cell infiltration (p < 0.01). CONCLUSION: This study establishes PTM networks as central regulators of CRC progression and immune resistance. The PTM-AS framework enables precision subtyping, while GALNT6 emerges as a novel therapeutic target for overcoming immunotherapy resistance.",

      "title": "Comparison of random survival forest and Cox regression for long-term prognosis of pediatric Wilms tumor: based on the SEER database and external validation cohort from China.",
      "journal": "Discover oncology",
      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Wilms tumor (WT) is the most common malignant renal tumor in children. Despite advances in treatment, accurate prediction of the long-term prognosis remains challenging. Various Cox regression-based models have been developed to assess WT survival rates; however, there is a pressing need for more precise tools. METHODS: Data from the SEER database (2000-2021) and external validation data from Chongqing Medical University Children's Hospital were utilized. Key prognostic factors for children with WT were identified via last absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression, which was subsequently used to construct the Random Survival Forest(RSF) model for long-term survival prediction. SHAP were applied to enhance the interpretability of the model. The model performance was compared to that of conventional Cox models via calibration curves, the Concordance index (C-index), the net reclassification index (NRI), and the integrated discrimination index (IDI). RESULTS: We included 1,629 children with WT from the SEER database and externally validated the model via data from 169 children at Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University(CHCMU). Kaplan\u2012Meier curves revealed higher mortality rates for Chinese children with WT than for their counterparts in the United States. LASSO regression identified six key variables for the development of the RSF and Cox models. The SHAP method was utilized to rank these variables in descending order of importance: tumor stage, age, lymph node density(LND), tumor metastasis, number of positive lymph nodes, and laterality (unilateral/bilateral). The RSF model demonstrated superior predictive performance and generalizability, as indicated by Brier scores, calibration curves, AUC curves, and risk curves. Moreover, the RSF model significantly outperformed the Cox model in terms of prediction accuracy (C-index: 0.868 vs. 0.759), with substantial improvements in the NRI and IDI (P < 0.01). Decision curve analysis also revealed that the RSF model provided a greater net benefit at 3, 5, and 7 years than did the Cox model, which underscored the greater clinical utility of the RSF model. Sensitivity analysis based on imputed data confirmed the robustness of the model, with consistent predictor selection and comparable performance metrics, further supported the stability and reliability of the RSF framework. CONCLUSION: We successfully developed a robust machine learning model that accurately assesses key prognostic factors affecting the long-term survival of children with WT. This model offers substantial clinical value for risk stratification and can assist clinicians in making more informed treatment decisions. By applying SHAP analysis, physicians can better understand the critical factors influencing WT prognosis and tailor intervention strategies more precisely.",

      "title": "Immunogenic cell death-related macrophage gene model for prognostic prediction in glioblastoma.",
      "journal": "Discover oncology",
      "abstract": "Glioblastoma (GBM) is an extremely aggressive and diverse type of brain tumor that is associated with a poor prognosis. Immunogenic cell death (ICD) is a particular form of cellular demise that is closely linked to antineoplastic immune responses. However, it is important to note that the function of ICD in GBM is not yet fully understood. Utilizing single-cell analysis, AddModuleScore, and weighted gene co-expression network analyses (WGCNA), ICD-related genes were identified at both the bulk transcriptome and single-cell levels. Based on these newly identified ICD-related genes, a novel signature for GBM was developed employing three machine learning methods: LASSO, XGBoost, and RandomForest. This prognostic model comprises four characteristic genes: G0S2, NEUROD1, SERPINE2, and LZTS1. The overall survival was significantly lower for the high-risk group compared to the low-risk group in the TCGA-GBM cohort (P < 0.001), CGGA693 cohort (P < 0.001), CGGA325 cohort (P < 0.001), and CGGA301 cohort (P < 0.001). This dichotomy indicates that the riskscore encapsulates a spectrum of tumor microenvironment phenotypes, ranging from immune-permissive (high-risk group) to immune-excluded (low-risk group), with direct implications for therapeutic response. Tumor microenvironment profiling has revealed that the high-risk patients display elevated stromal and immune scores, alongside reduced tumor purity, indicative of a densely infiltrated, macrophage-rich microenvironment. By elucidating the interaction between ICD and macrophage biology, this study establishes a robust prognostic model that surpasses traditional clinical parameters, offering insights into tumor microenvironment immunity and therapeutic vulnerabilities in GBM.",

      "journal": "Functional & integrative genomics",
      "abstract": "This study aims to refine molecular subtypes via multi-omics data, develop a prognostic signature, and identify novel biomarkers in colorectal cancer (CRC). On the basis of the multi-omics data, the MOVICS R package was used to divide patients with CRC into three consensus subtypes (CSs). Among the 3 CSs, CS1 had higher immune scores, immune checkpoint expression, infiltration of immune cells, and sensitivity to chemotherapy drugs. Specific markers of CS1 were identified, and 101 combinations of machine learning methods were applied for calculating the consensus machine learning-based score (CMLS) and constructing the CMLS signature for predicting patient survival. CMLS showed high efficiency in predicting the outcome of patients across multiple CRC datasets, and the results demonstrated that CMLS was an independent prognostic factor in CRC. The high- and low-CMLS groups presented distinct immune landscapes. CMLS was linked to malignant cancer features, suggesting its potential as a predictor of malignant progression in diverse cancers. Among the genes used to calculate CMLS, the role of inhibin subunit beta B (INHBB) in CRC remains unexplored. Expression analysis of INHBB across different cancer types revealed its upregulation in CRC, which was further validated by western blot and immunohistochemistry (IHC) experiments. INHBB silencing significantly inhibited tumor cell proliferation and migration, decreased phosphorylated AKT and N-cadherin levels, and increased E-cadherin expression. INHBB potentially suppresses CRC development and progression by suppressing the AKT signaling pathway and the EMT process.",

      "journal": "Metabolomics : Official journal of the Metabolomic Society",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: As the most common benign gynecological tumor in women, uterine fibroids not only pose a serious threat to reproductive health but also directly impair fertility. The structural abnormalities of the uterus and metabolic disturbances they induce have become critical pathological contributors to infertility, recurrent miscarriage, and obstetric complications in reproductive-aged women. However, the underlying metabolic mechanisms of uterine fibroids remain poorly understood. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore metabolic remodeling of uterine fibroids from patients. METHODS: We performed global metabolomics analysis on myometrium and uterine fibroid tissues by combining ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS) analysis and gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis. Spatially resolved metabolomics was carried out to analyze intratumor metabolic heterogeneity via desorption electrospray ionization mass spectrometry imaging (DESI-MSI). Combined with machine learning, important metabolites related to uterine fibroids were identified. RESULTS: This study enabled mapping a comprehensive metabolome atlas up to 825 metabolites in human myometrium and uterine fibroid tissues via combining UHPLC-MS with GC-MS. Metabolic shifts from myometrium to uterine fibroids were clearly observed, which was accompanied by large changes in metabolites and amino acid metabolic pathways to display metabolic remodeling of uterine fibroids. Combined with machine learning, a total of ten metabolites were identified to characterize metabolic properties of uterine fibroids. Furthermore, DESI-MSI was employed to effectively differentiate regions of hyaline degeneration from those devoid of such degeneration, thereby firstly highlighting the intrinsic metabolic heterogeneity present in uterine fibroids. CONCLUSION: The findings offer new insights into the metabolic pathophysiology of fibroids, which may aid in the development of targeted therapeutic strategies for this widespread gynecological disorder.",

      "journal": "International journal of colorectal disease",
      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: In this study, we constructed a new pCR predictor based on dynamic tumor marker changes before and after NCRT, the dynamic tumor marker score (DTMS), and combined it with other clinicopathological features to build a machine-learning model. METHODS: In this retrospective study of patients with LARC between September 2010 and October 2017 at The First Affiliated Hospital of Fujian Medical University (FJMUFAH), Fujian Medical University Union Hospital (FJMUUH), and Fujian Provincial Hospital (FJPH), the DTMS predictor was constructed using logistic regression. Factors associated with pCR were screened using single-factor and multifactorial logistic regression, and 10 machine-learning algorithms were used to construct a pCR prediction model. Additionally, various metrics, including the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC), decision curve analysis, and calibration curves, were obtained to validate the model performance and verified using an external validation set. Finally, SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values were used to interpret the predictive model. Moreover, we developed a website to facilitate the use of prediction modeling. RESULTS: After analyzing the data of 892 patients with LARC from FJMUFAH, DTMS, tumor size, N stage, and tumor distance from the anal verge were identified as independent predictive factors for pCR using univariate and multivariate regression analyses. The \"extreme gradient boosting\" (XGB) model displayed the best performance in the training set, with a mean AUC value of 0.86, an AUPRC value of 0.732, and SHAP values utilized in the analysis. In the two external validation sets, the model yielded AUC values of 0.80 and 0.82, along with corresponding AUPRC values of 0.519 and 0.593, respectively, which were the highest among all ten evaluated models, incorporating the use of SHAP values in the analysis. The model maintained superior predictive efficacy in the external validation cohorts (FJMUUH and FJPH). CONCLUSIONS: As a novel marker based on dynamic changes in CEA and CA19-9 levels, DTMS effectively predicted pCR within the XGB model, providing clinicians with a practical tool for treatment decision-making regarding LARC.",

      "title": "Strategies to improve photosynthesis by modifying the RuBisCO system and its limitations.",
      "journal": "Molecular biology reports",
      "abstract": "RuBisCO (Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase) is the primary enzyme responsible for carbon fixation in the Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle, yet it remains one of the most inefficient enzymes in nature. Its slow catalytic rate, low specificity for CO\u2082 over O\u2082, and susceptibility to inhibition and heat stress limit photosynthetic efficiency and crop productivity, particularly under fluctuating environmental conditions. This review highlights current strategies to enhance RuBisCO performance. These include direct mutagenesis, ancestral protein reconstruction, and the incorporation of chimeric or heterologous RuBisCO subunits to improve kinetics and stability. Enhancing the expression of native or foreign RuBisCO subunits, as well as engineering thermostable RuBisCO activase, further supports improved photosynthetic capacity. Additionally, the integration of carbon-concentrating mechanisms such as cyanobacterial carboxysomes and algal pyrenoids offers promising avenues to increase CO\u2082 availability around RuBisCO. Emerging synthetic biology approaches, including artificial carbon fixation pathways, aim to bypass the limitations of natural photosynthesis altogether. We have also discussed the limitations of each method. Complementing these advances, artificial intelligence and machine learning are being increasingly used to predict beneficial mutations, model enzyme behaviour, and guide protein engineering. Together, these multidisciplinary strategies hold great potential to optimize RuBisCO, improve crop yields, and enhance resilience in a changing climate.",

      "abstract": "The D-Dimer testing has limited diagnostic value for patients with a deep venous thrombosis (DVT) probability based on clinical prediction rules. There are still patients with normal D-Dimer levels (< 500 ng/mL) diagnosed with DVT. Some new predictive marker may improve the predictive power of D-Dimer, especially in DVT patients with normal levels of D-Dimer. All subjects were from Nanyang Central Hospital. The demographic data and laboratory test data were collected. Multiple models were used to evaluate and calculate the importance rank. Multivariate logistics was used to establish a DVT diagnostic model. Compared to D-Dimer and other markers, this combined model has better performance. The von Willebrand factor Gain-of-function mutant GPIb binding assays (VWF: GPIbM) can improve the diagnostic capability of D-Dimer, which has higher diagnostic value and clinical benefits. In addition, the model still has good diagnostic capability in DVT patients with normal D-Dimer levels. The combined model has better diagnostic performance than D-Dimer, and it is valuable for some patients whose clinical prediction rules cannot be evaluated due to difficulties in obtaining medical history information. VWF: GPIbM can be used to assist in the diagnosis of DVT in the future.",

      "journal": "Biological cybernetics",
      "abstract": "Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have emerged as a powerful and extensively employed tool in biomedical research, offering insights into intricate biomolecular processes such as structural flexibility and molecular interactions, and playing a pivotal role in the development of therapeutic approaches. Although MD techniques are applied to a variety of biomolecules including DNA, RNA, proteins, and their assemblies, this review focuses specifically on the role of MD in elucidating protein behavior and their interactions with inhibitors across different disease contexts. The selection of an appropriate force field is essential, as it greatly influences the reliability of simulation outcomes. Widely adopted MD software packages such as GROMACS, DESMOND, and AMBER leverage rigorously tested force fields and have shown consistent performance across diverse biological applications. Despite current successes, challenges remain in narrowing the gap between computational models and actual cellular conditions. The integration of machine learning and deep learning technologies is expected to accelerate progress in this evolving field.",

      "journal": "Supportive care in cancer : official journal of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer",
      "abstract": "PURPOSE: This study aimed to analyze the influencing factors of moderate-to-severe cancer-related fatigue (CRF) in colorectal cancer (CRC) chemotherapy patients and to develop a predictive risk stratification model. METHODS: A total of 630 CRC chemotherapy patients were selected from five hospitals in China. Data were collected using a general information forms, the Piper Fatigue Scale-Revised (PFS-R), the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). The data was randomly divided into a training set and a test set in a 7:3 ratio, and feature selection was performed using univariate analysis and LASSO regression. Five machine learning algorithms were used to construct moderate-to-severe CRF models. The Shapley additive explanation (SHAP) method is used to increase the interpretability of the optimal performance model. RESULTS: The overall incidence of moderate-to-severe CRF was 70.5%. The random forest (RF) model performed the best, with an AUC of 0.906, sensitivity of 0.943, accuracy of 0.931, precision of 0.977, specificity of 0.848, and F1 score of 0.960. Based on the analysis of the absolute mean SHAP values, the feature importance of the RF model, from highest to lowest, was sleep quality score, anxiety score, anorexia, magnesium ion concentration, smoking history, place of residence, and cancer stage. CONCLUSIONS: The RF model demonstrated superior predictive performance, positioning it as a viable screening tool for assessing the risk of moderate-to-severe CRF in CRC patients receiving chemotherapy. This approach may facilitate early intervention and improve clinical management of CRF symptoms.",

      "journal": "The journals of gerontology. Series A, Biological sciences and medical sciences",
      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Assessment of frailty has become common in clinical settings to risk-stratify older adults. Understanding how to use repeated measurements answers important questions both for the clinical use of serial assessments and understanding frailty trajectories. METHODS: Using 2012-16 Health and Retirement Study data, we calculated six summary measures of assessments of frailty index (FI, 3 assessments) and Fried Frailty Phenotype (FFP, 2 assessments): most recent value, maximum, minimum, mean, standard deviation (SD), and delta. We assessed the association of scaled values with mortality and institutionalization between 2016 and 2018, and three measures of epigenetic aging collected in 2016 using Cox, logistic, and linear regression respectively with adjustment for age, sex, and smoking. We then used LASSO regression to determine which summary measures were most often retained. RESULTS: 14,451 and 2,196 individuals had complete data for FI and FFP respectively. The maximum and most recent frailty values had the strongest associations with the outcomes considered, while those of SD and delta were weakest. In LASSO regressions, the maximum and most recent values were most commonly retained (12-13 of 20 regressions), followed by SD (7), mean (6), and minimum and delta (1 each). CONCLUSIONS: These findings show that maximum and most recent values of frailty tend to be most strongly associated with mortality. For clinicians, this means that the most recent assessment may be sufficient for many purposes and if historical data are unavailable.

This in silico proof-of-concept study aimed to computationally model and predict neuromuscular adaptations induced by strength and plyometric training, integrating musculoskeletal simulations and machine learning techniques. A validated musculoskeletal model (OpenSim 4.4; 23 DOF, 92 musculotendon actuators) was scaled to a representative athlete (180 cm, 75 kg). Plyometric (vertical jumps, horizontal broad jumps, drop jumps) and strength exercises (back squat, deadlift, leg press) were simulated to evaluate biomechanical responses, including ground reaction forces, muscle activations, joint kinetics, and rate of force development (RFD). Predictive analyses employed artificial neural networks and random forest regression models trained on extracted biomechanical data. The results show plyometric tasks with GRF 22.1-30.2 N\u00b7kg",
