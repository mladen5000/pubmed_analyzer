      "title": "Understanding the Mental and Physical Burdens of Physicians and Identifying Support Interventions in Bangladesh: Qualitative Study.",
      "journal": "Interactive journal of medical research",
      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic had a substantial, negative impact on the world, and physicians played a crucial role in providing health care while facing the risk of contracting the virus themselves. While working on the frontlines, they also needed to protect themselves and their families from the virus. Unfortunately, their mental health was not given the attention it deserved. Many physicians experienced burnout due to the numerous challenges they faced, yet they received little support. Resource-limited countries such as Bangladesh were particularly affected due to a lack of resources. Although high-income countries have proposed a well-being model for physicians, this model is not directly applicable to resource-limited nations. However, redefining the model to suit the specific needs of physicians in resource-limited countries could provide sustainable support for their well-being. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to gain a deeper understanding of the mental and physical burdens faced by Bangladeshi physicians during the COVID-19 pandemic, and the contextual factors influencing their well-being. By understanding these aspects, we can recommend an adaptable, effective, and sustainable contextual model. METHODS: We conducted semistructured online interviews with 14 physicians in Chattogram, Bangladesh, during the COVID-19 pandemic. The physicians actively working in the COVID-19 unit were recruited from public and private hospitals through purposive sampling. Participants were aged between 25 and 35 years and had up to 8 years of working experience, including 43% (6/14) interns, 36% (5/14) medical officers, 14% (2/14) researchers, and 7% (1/14) surgeons. Each interview was conducted in Bengali, and we obtained consent to record the audio. Overall, 637 minutes of discussion were translated and transcribed. The results were analyzed using reflexive thematic analysis. RESULTS: We identified factors that impacted physicians' mental and physical health and well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic. They frequently dealt with undiagnosed patients, which put them at risk. Physicians often feared the potential danger their profession posed to their families, choosing to prioritize their family's safety over their own. In addition, heavy workloads, excessive duty hours, and a shortage of colleagues substantially affected their sleep patterns and disrupted their regular work schedules. Instead of receiving societal support, they often faced negative perceptions from the public. In addition, during times of mass patient deaths, many physicians struggled to cope with their emotions without any mental health support. CONCLUSIONS: Our work shows physicians' mental and physical health burdens with various contextual difficulties. We understood these concerns and suggested a contextual (emphasizes understanding and addressing users' behavior within its specific context) intervention model inspired by the well-being framework. We emphasize the importance of integrating both contextual and technological interventions. Through this model, our goal is to involve stakeholders in redesigning the work environment for physicians, ensuring it is sustainable in the long term and adaptable to different situations.",

      "journal": "Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy",
      "abstract": "Immunocompromised patients (ICPs) infected with SARS-CoV-2 are at higher risk of severe illness. Some experience persistent viral shedding beyond eight weeks, which is associated with increased mortality and invasive fungal infections. However, data on the clinical profile, treatment impact, and standardized management for these patients remain limited. We conducted a retrospective cohort study at Groupe Hospitalier Paris Centre between March 1, 2020, and February 10, 2024. We assessed symptomatic ICPs with persistent SARS-CoV-2 shedding (>8 weeks), analyzing clinical progression, time to viral clearance, and emergence of resistance mutations in relation to treatment regimens. Fifty-three patients were included: 53% were solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients, 42% had hematological malignancies (HMs), and 5% had other immunosuppressive conditions. Severe infections occurred in 32%, 91% required hospitalization, and 17% (",

      "title": "Performance and characteristics of three digital PCR platforms for detection and quantification of viral targets in wastewater.",
      "journal": "Journal of applied microbiology",
      "abstract": "AIMS: The wider implementation of wastewater-based surveillance (WBS) has increased the necessity for nucleic acid detection and quantification from complex samples. Here, we compared the performance and the characteristics of three digital PCR (dPCR) platforms. METHODS AND RESULTS: The dPCR platforms selected in this study included the QX200 AutoDG Droplet Digital PCR System from Bio-Rad, the QIAcuity One, 2plex Device from Qiagen, and the 3-color Naica System manufactured by Stilla Technologies. Platforms were compared and described based on their handling in the laboratory and performance quantifying two viral targets - SARS-CoV-2 and Norovirus GII - in wastewater samples. Our findings showed that no single platform consistently outperformed the others in terms of target quantification. Moreover, we observed similarities amongst the systems with respect to resilience to inhibition, but differences in laboratory handling including sample throughput and method of quantification. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that all three selected dPCR platforms are similarly suitable for WBS, as quantitative performance of the systems for viral RNA targets extracted from wastewater is comparable. Decisions on platform selection can be driven by researcher preference on handling, throughput, and other differentiating characteristics.",

      "title": "Changes in rural China's caregiver outcomes, behaviours, and health services utilisation following the COVID-19 pandemic: an observational study.",
      "journal": "Journal of global health",
      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Under-resourced communities in rural China have long faced limitations in accessing and utilising caregiver and child healthcare (CCH). The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated health inequities globally, while its precise impacts on CCH remain understudied. We report differences in parental migration, maternal mental health, household and nutrition expenditures, child feeding practices, and prenatal, postnatal, and childbirth care following pandemic lockdowns in rural China. METHODS: We compared two groups of families with children who grew to the age of six months either before or during lockdowns. We enrolled eligible households from 80 rural townships, randomly selected from four poverty-designated counties in Sichuan Province, China. We interviewed the control group of primary caregivers in November and December of 2019 (pre-COVID-19), and the case group in May of 2020 (approximately five months into the pandemic). Statistical analyses included t tests and linear regressions with adjustments. P-values <0.05 were considered statistically significant. RESULTS: Compared to the control group, the case group presented significantly lower paternal migration and more favourable maternal mental health. Caregiving behaviours (including household and nutrition expenditures) and child feeding practices did not differ, except for higher spending on infant micronutrient supplements. Prenatal health services utilisation, including home visits, was slightly higher, while postnatal services utilisation was lower. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that many aspects of CCH in rural China were similar or improved during the early pandemic lockdowns. These data highlight the importance of promoting targeted public health interventions, such as mental health support initiatives, accessible perinatal care options, and family-centred education campaigns, in under-resourced communities and during future healthcare crises.",

      "title": "Trends in opioid prescribing by oncologists for Medicare beneficiaries from 2014 to 2022.",
      "journal": "Journal of managed care & specialty pharmacy",
      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Overprescribing of opioids has led to hundreds of thousands of overdose deaths and substantial health care costs. In response, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) implemented a revised Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) for opioids in 2018. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate trends in opioid prescribing by oncologists for Medicare Part D beneficiaries from 2014 to 2022. METHODS: This cross-sectional study used data from the 2014-2022 Medicare Part D Prescriber Public Use Files. Opioid claims and prescribing trends were assessed by opioid types, oncologist subspecialty, geographic region, and rurality status. An interrupted time series analysis was conducted to assess the changes in oncologists' prescribing patterns before and after the 2018 REMS modifications. RESULTS: The analysis included 25,371 unique oncologists, with the majority being male (66%) and specializing in hematology-oncology (47%). Over the study period, oncologists issued more than 9.4 million opioid prescriptions, with long-acting opioids accounting for 18% of these claims. Hematology-oncology specialists were responsible for the largest share of the prescriptions (67%). Oncologists practicing in the South and rural areas exhibited higher prescribing rates and longer average supply durations than those in other regions. A national sustainable decline in opioid prescribing was observed among oncologists between 2014 and 2022, with a significant immediate decline following 2018 in which the REMS changes were implemented. CONCLUSIONS: The 2018 FDA REMS update coincided with significant declines in opioid prescribing by oncologists treating Medicare beneficiaries. Although other factors, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, may have also contributed to this decline, the sustained downward trend over time highlights the need for targeted policies and tailored provider education to ensure effective cancer pain management and to address persistent regional and rural-urban disparities in prescribing practices.",
