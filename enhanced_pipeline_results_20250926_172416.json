      "journal": "Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy",
      "abstract": "Immunocompromised patients (ICPs) infected with SARS-CoV-2 are at higher risk of severe illness. Some experience persistent viral shedding beyond eight weeks, which is associated with increased mortality and invasive fungal infections. However, data on the clinical profile, treatment impact, and standardized management for these patients remain limited. We conducted a retrospective cohort study at Groupe Hospitalier Paris Centre between March 1, 2020, and February 10, 2024. We assessed symptomatic ICPs with persistent SARS-CoV-2 shedding (>8 weeks), analyzing clinical progression, time to viral clearance, and emergence of resistance mutations in relation to treatment regimens. Fifty-three patients were included: 53% were solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients, 42% had hematological malignancies (HMs), and 5% had other immunosuppressive conditions. Severe infections occurred in 32%, 91% required hospitalization, and 17% (",

      "title": "Changes in rural China's caregiver outcomes, behaviours, and health services utilisation following the COVID-19 pandemic: an observational study.",
      "journal": "Journal of global health",
      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Under-resourced communities in rural China have long faced limitations in accessing and utilising caregiver and child healthcare (CCH). The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated health inequities globally, while its precise impacts on CCH remain understudied. We report differences in parental migration, maternal mental health, household and nutrition expenditures, child feeding practices, and prenatal, postnatal, and childbirth care following pandemic lockdowns in rural China. METHODS: We compared two groups of families with children who grew to the age of six months either before or during lockdowns. We enrolled eligible households from 80 rural townships, randomly selected from four poverty-designated counties in Sichuan Province, China. We interviewed the control group of primary caregivers in November and December of 2019 (pre-COVID-19), and the case group in May of 2020 (approximately five months into the pandemic). Statistical analyses included t tests and linear regressions with adjustments. P-values <0.05 were considered statistically significant. RESULTS: Compared to the control group, the case group presented significantly lower paternal migration and more favourable maternal mental health. Caregiving behaviours (including household and nutrition expenditures) and child feeding practices did not differ, except for higher spending on infant micronutrient supplements. Prenatal health services utilisation, including home visits, was slightly higher, while postnatal services utilisation was lower. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that many aspects of CCH in rural China were similar or improved during the early pandemic lockdowns. These data highlight the importance of promoting targeted public health interventions, such as mental health support initiatives, accessible perinatal care options, and family-centred education campaigns, in under-resourced communities and during future healthcare crises.",

      "title": "SARS-CoV-2 infection in lung transplant recipients: a single-center retrospective study in Japan.",
      "journal": "Surgery today",
      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Lung transplant (LTx) recipients are at a higher risk of infection and mortality due to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The course of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Japanese LTx recipients remains unknown. This study aimed to clarify the incidence, outcomes, and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in LTx recipients in Japan over a 3-year period. METHODS: This single-center retrospective study enrolled all LTx recipients who underwent LTx at Kyoto University Hospital between June 2008 and December 2022 and who were followed up during the COVID-19 pandemic from March 2020 to June 2023. RESULTS: Among 230 LTx recipients, 64 (27.8%) developed SARS-CoV-2 infection and one (1.6%) died due to COVID-19. No significant differences in baseline characteristics, except for hypertension, were observed between the LTx recipients with and without COVID-19. Disease severity decreased as variants of concern transitioned but remained high even after 2022. Unilateral LTx, advanced age, and diabetes mellitus were associated with COVID-19 severity. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of COVID-19 in LTx recipients was similar to that in the general Japanese population, whereas the disease severity in LTx recipients remained high even after the Omicron era. Continuous development of preventive and early therapeutic interventions is required for these vulnerable groups.",

      "title": "Differences in Marine Toxin Poisonings Reported to US Poison Centers After Pandemic Restrictions.",
      "journal": "Toxins",
      "abstract": "This study investigated whether marine toxin poisonings reported to U.S. Poison Centers changed during the height of the pandemic period (April 2020 to December 2021). The National Poison Data System was queried for single-substance human exposure calls between 1 January 2000 and 31 March 2022 pertaining to ichthyosarcotoxins. Incidence rate ratios for exposure calls were calculated using mixed-effects negative binomial regression. Call counts were aggregated by year and regressed on a binary indicator for occurrence during pandemic restrictions. During the peak pandemic period, exposure calls decreased for several toxins: ciguatera poisoning: 0.57 (0.43, 0.76); clupeotoxic fish poisoning: 0.12 (0.04, 0.39); diarrhetic shellfish poisoning: 0.28 (0.16, 0.49); paralytic shellfish poisoning: 0.23 (0.17, 0.33); scombroid fish poisoning: 0.46 (0.36, 0.57). However, palytoxin poisoning (1.94 (1.32, 2.84)) and tetrodotoxin poisoning (1.73 (1.46, 2.04)) exposure calls appear to have increased. All results were Bonferroni-significant (",

      "title": "Weekend Effect and Predictors of Mortality for Patients Presenting to Emergency Department with COVID-19 Infection.",
      "journal": "Journal of personalized medicine",
      "abstract": "Background: Weekend presentation to the emergency department (ED) has been associated with increased morbidity and mortality in various clinical settings. However, the literature is scant whether such an effect exists for patients presenting with COVID-19 infection. Additionally, comparative analyses of mortality predictors in COVID-19 patients evaluated at the emergency department need further exploration. Methods: This retrospective cohort study examined factors associated with mortality among adult patients (aged \u2265 18 years) who presented with COVID-19 to the emergency departments of five hospitals within the Johns Hopkins Health System (combined capacity: 2513 beds) between March 1 and 4 May 2020. Data were extracted from electronic health records. Multivariable logistic regression was utilized to assess the relationship between mortality and a range of variables, including sociodemographic characteristics, clinical presentation, laboratory parameters, pre-existing comorbidities, and weekend versus weekday presentation. Results: Of the 2767 patients, 685 (25%) presented to the emergency department on weekends. Compared to weekday presenters, weekend patients were more likely to be hospitalized (64%), and these patients had a mean symptom duration of 5 days (SD \u00b1 6). Weekend presenters also exhibited higher rates of clinical frailty, dehydration, hypoxia, and respiratory distress upon arrival. In multivariable logistic regression analysis adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics, clinical risk factors, and laboratory findings, independent predictors of increased mortality included absence of a primary care provider (OR 3.47; 95% CI: 2.37-5.07), peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) < 95% at presentation (OR 1.46; 95% CI: 1.001-2.12), and hyperglycemia (OR 2.13; 95% CI: 1.25-3.65). Notably, the presence of crackles on physical examination demonstrated a trend toward reduced mortality (OR 0.47; 95% CI: 0.24-0.92). Conclusions: While weekend presentation was associated with higher hospitalization rates among patients with COVID-19, it did not independently predict increased mortality. Absence of a primary care provider, hypoxia, and hyperglycemia at presentation emerged as strong, independent predictors of mortality in the ED setting. Race, gender, and obesity were not significantly associated with mortality in this cohort, warranting further investigation. These findings may support more effective triage and risk stratification strategies in current and future public health emergencies.",
