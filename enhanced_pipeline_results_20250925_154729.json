      "title": "COVID-19 Impact on Adolescent Vaccination Administration Rates in the US Military Health System.",
      "journal": "The Journal of adolescent health : official publication of the Society for Adolescent Medicine",
      "abstract": "PURPOSE: The COVID-19 pandemic had far-reaching impacts on the delivery of preventive health care to pediatric patients worldwide, including outpatient vaccination. Our study assessed the repercussions of the pandemic on the delivery of adolescent vaccines. METHODS: We utilized the TRICARE Management Activity's Military Health System (MHS) Data Repository to measure the delivery of Human Papillomavirus (HPV), Tetanus, Diphtheria, Pertussis (Tdap), Meningococcal Conjugate Vaccine (MCV4), seasonal influenza (flu), and Neisseria meningitidis serogroup B (MenB) vaccines to adolescent children of United States (U.S.) military members during the prepandemic (March 2018-February 2020) and COVID-19 pandemic (March 2020-February 2022) periods, as well as the delivery of COVID-19 vaccine after it became available. We included those patients aged 11-21 years and eligible for TRICARE health care during these periods and indirectly measured vaccine delivery using the number of Current Procedural Terminology (CPT)-coded vaccinations administered per month to eligible adolescents. RESULTS: We found that the monthly rates of Human Papillomavirus, Tetanus, Diphtheria, Pertussis, and seasonal influenza vaccination declined during the COVID-19 pandemic as compared to the prepandemic period. In contrast, the monthly rates of MCV4 rose during the second year of the pandemic, and MenB vaccination increased over both years. When COVID-19 vaccination was available, dependent adolescents living outside the continental United States had >2-fold higher COVID-19 vaccination rate than those living in the continental US. We also identified broadly higher vaccination rates among the adolescent children of officers as compared to the adolescent children of junior enlisted members, despite universal insurance coverage to preventive health-care services within the Military Health System. DISCUSSION: Adolescent vaccination rates in military dependents declined during COVID-19, especially among junior enlisted families and western regions, with slow recovery except for meningococcal vaccines.",

      "journal": "La Clinica terapeutica",
      "abstract": "Pandemics expose vulnerabilities in health systems but also reaf-firm the central role of prevention. Evidence from H1N1 and COVID-19 highlights three decisive dimensions: protection of healthcare workers, vaccine uptake among youth, and public health measures such as contact tracing. Correct personal protective equipment (PPE) use and limited exposure proved essential in healthcare settings, while vaccination markedly reduced severity and supported control of spread. Experiences across both pandemics converge on one lesson: integrating individual preventive practices with immunization is indispensable to mitigate transmission, reduce disease burden, and strengthen preparedness for future threats.",

      "title": "Estimating Population Immunity and Impact of COVID-19 Vaccination in Washington State and Oregon.",
      "journal": "Open forum infectious diseases",
      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) mRNA vaccine showed high clinical efficacy against the ancestral variant, but immunological waning, emergence of new variants, and the durability of infection-induced immunity complicate the estimation of population-level effectiveness. We used mathematical modeling to calculate the proportion of hospitalizations averted by vaccination in Washington and Oregon. METHODS: We used an age- and region-structured compartmental model of vaccine-induced and infection-induced immunity from January 2020 until December 2022. We parameterized the strength and durability of immunity via a meta-regression of vaccine efficacy. We calibrated a time-varying contact matrix to weekly hospitalizations reported by the Washington Department of Health and Oregon Health Authority. We validated our model with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention serosurveillance data. To estimate vaccine effectiveness, we created counterfactual scenarios with no vaccination either in the entire population or in select age groups. RESULTS: We found that total hospitalizations were reduced 74% (95% credible interval [CrI], 69%-78%) and 15% (95% CrI, 9%-19%) by primary vaccination and boosters, respectively. Vaccination effectiveness was highest during the Alpha wave, averting 90% (95% CrI, 88%-93%) of hospitalizations and in people aged 65+, averting 78% (95% CrI, 73%-81%). Relative to only vaccinating individuals aged 50+, vaccination of individuals aged 18-49 averted 52% (95% CrI, 44%-58%) of hospitalizations overall and 42% (95% CrI, 35%-48%) of hospitalizations among individuals 65+. CONCLUSIONS: The SARS-CoV-2 vaccination program in Washington and Oregon averted the majority of hospitalizations. Vaccinating individuals aged 18-49 significantly reduced hospitalization among individuals aged 65+.",

      "title": "Incidence of Recurrent Adverse Cardiovascular Events Among Patients With Acute Myocardial Infarction During the First Wave of the COVID-19 Pandemic in Bangladesh: A Prospective Observational Study.",
      "journal": "Health science reports",
      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIMS: COVID-19 is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease. We investigated undiagnosed COVID-19 and its effect on recurrent adverse cardiovascular events among patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI). METHODS: We enrolled patients with either ST-segment elevation (STEMI) or non ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) presenting at the National Institute of Cardiovascular Disease, Dhaka, from June 28 to August 11, 2020. Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected for SARS-CoV-2 testing by rRT-PCR at enrolment. We followed all patients from admission until February 7, 2021, before the COVID-19 vaccination in Bangladesh, to register clinical endpoints (all-cause death, new AMI, heart failure, or new revascularization). Demographic information, cardiovascular risk factors, and clinical data were registered. Incidence rate (IR) per 100 person-years follow-up was calculated for clinical endpoints. Poisson regression was employed to estimate the incidence rate ratio (IRR) for SARS-COV-2 infection, adjusting for age. RESULTS: We enrolled 280 patients with a mean age of 54.5 (\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD,11.8) years, and 78.6% were males. Of them, 12.9% had undiagnosed SARS-CoV-2 infection and were diagnosed with STEMI ( CONCLUSION: This study provides updated data on undiagnosed cases among AMI patients during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our findings emphasize the need for further research to explore the impact of COVID-19 on AMI patients in resource-limited settings like Bangladesh.",
